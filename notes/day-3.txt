4. PL/SQL:
	Procedural Language extensions for the Structured Query Language (PL/SQL).
	SQL: It's a database language both for querying and updating data in the RDBMS.
	PL/SQL adds many programming constructs to the SQL. It helps to overcome the limitations of SQL. It is very well readable.
	PL/SQL is an embeded language. It is part of Oracle database. It can't be used like any other stand-alone programming language like python, c, c++, c#, Java etc. It can be executed in a system where Oracle database is installed.

	architecture:
	a. when you try to execute the PL/SQL block, behind the scene an engine, named, PL/SQL engine takes care of compilation and execution of the PL/SQL block, in  collaboration with SQL engine. the PL part of the PL/SQL is compiled by Procedural Statement Executor of PL/SQL engine and the SQL part of the PL/SQL is compiled and executed by SQL statement executor. the PL/SQL engine converts the actual code into byte code and then that code gets executed.
   
	Sections in PL/SQL block:
		a. declaration section
		b. Executable section
		c. Exception-Handling section
   	Blocks:
		a. anonymous block: can't be saved in database as database object. 
		b. named block: stored procedure, triggers, functions etc. are named pl/sql blocks. they can be saved in database as database objects.
